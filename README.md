# Clinikally Autocomplete Component

This is a responsive autocomplete input component built with React + TypeScript + Vite, created as part of the Clinikally internship assignment.

##  Features

- Debounced search input
- Product suggestions fetched from a public API
- "Load More" pagination
- Loading and error states
- "No products found" message

##  Note
  The main component code is located in the src/components directory.

  
  Also, inline styling is used to keep things simple. For a bigger project, I would move the styles to a separate CSS file or use Tailwind CSS.

##  Thought Process

The goal was to build a clean, intuitive component that feels fast and user-friendly. I focused on keeping the UI minimal, handling edge cases like loading states and empty results, and ensuring smooth UX with debouncing and pagination.

## Setup Instructions
npm install
npm run dev
